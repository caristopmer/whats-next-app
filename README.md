# Unstuck (previously What's Next?)

### An app for simple reflection & self-care

Everyone has had that moment of inertia, when life has dealt you a hand and you're not sure which card to play. Maybe you're in bed, staring at the ceiling. Maybe you just moved to a new city, and leaving your apartment feels like too much just yet. Or maybe life is great, and you want to celebrate somehow.

Tell Unstuck how your day is going. Using the [Emoj API](https://medium.com/@dannyfreed/today-im-launching-emoj-an-api-that-can-interpret-emotion-from-a-text-based-conversation-6b2ea3fa98b), Unstuck analyzes your emotional state and chooses an array of small, manageable, low-stakes activities that might make your day a little brighter, or start you on the right direction for what comes after.

Future steps include adding user registration for tracking emotional state over time.
